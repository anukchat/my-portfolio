I am also responsible for creating gold standard datasets and create analytics out of it. I use various Statistics and Machine Learning based techniques to solve complex data quality problems. Prior to Avalara I worked at Tieto, FIS Global & TCS on creating utilities and frameworks for solving complex data quality problems. I personally like doing projects that create social impact like helping Agriculture use modern AI based techniques to increase their productivity, I also have interests in Image Processing, Web3, Robotics & Space technologies. I participate in various hackathons and competetions at Kaggle.\n\nIf you think I can be helpful to you or would like to meet me, please feel free to get in touch.\n\n# Currently\n\nAt Avalara, I have learned how to build tools for on-line predictive models with technologies like [Dask](https://dask.org/), [Dagster](https://dagster.io/), [PyTorch](https://www.pytorch.org/), and [spaCy](https://spacy.io/). I mostly progrtam in Python , but have good experience in C#, Java, front end technology like React.js, Cloud based services like AWS EC2, Athena, Glue, EMR, DataLake, S3 etc. \n\n# Some history\n\n- I was born in Steel City of India: Bhilai, famous for Asia's largest Steel Plant and is also famous for its well planned township and high quality education. I was introduced with a computer when I was 6-7 year old, it was a big Black & White box with only a mechanical keyboard and the first program i ran was LOTUS to draw shapes using commands. \n\n- Thanks to my father , I developed a huge interest in physics and specifically astro physics, my father was a Physics Lecturer and his way of teaching developed a huge interest in me.\n\n- I was first introduced with a proper Windows XP based Pentium IV computer when I was 13 year old, it was a dream to have internet back then. \n\n- The first computer language i was introduced with was C and C++, I also subscribed digit magazines to explore more on computers.\n\n- The first modern game i played (i still do) in computer was GTA San Andreas , It was the heaviset game which later started effecting my computer.\n\n- I was introduced with internet at an age of 14, it was a dial up connection, back then 2 mbps used to be highest speed one can get.\n\n- I always have been fond of electronic machines and robotics, I enjoyed almost any machine big or small and reverse engineer it to understand its working. At times i used to fix up things but many times I used to just open and leave it as it is. \n\n- At 16, I bought an advanced tool set out of my pocket money, to start creating projects on Robotics and program micro controllers.\n\n- At 18, I went for graduation in Electronics & Telecommunication , i choose the stream because of huge interest in electronics\n\n- At 21, i presented paper at IEEE conference on an Image Processing based real time Steel Plate monitoring in Steel Plants.\n\n\nAsk me in person for other stories that I'm afraid to share with the internet.\n\n# I like\n\n- Running\n- Swimming\n- Playing Badminton\n- Playing Guitar\n- Space\n- Physics\n- [Books](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/144204451-anukool)\n- Books on Technology\n\n# Travel / Geography\n\n- I am from originally from Bhilai, India. I have not much travelled abroad but travelled within India alot of times.\n- I travelled in South to see the last point of India at Kanyakumari where the 3 Oceans meet and saw Rock Memorial where Swami Vivekananda meditated for 3 days and nights continuosly and got enlightenment.\n- I travelled to Rameshwaram in Tamil Nadu, where our great president Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam was born.\n- I travelled to Madurai, Kerala, Chennai, Mysore, Bangalore and many more places in south.\n- I travelled in North to see Dharmashala , where house of Dalai Lama is present.\n- I travelled to Mathura, a divine place where Lord Krishna was born. I travelled to Haridwar,Rishikesh, Lansdown and many more places.\n- I live in Pune now, sorrounded by Sahyadri mountains know as trekker's paradise, i keep exploring new places to be in.\n- I am an enthusiastic traveller and keep exploring new places.\n\n# Fun facts\n\n- I own couple of Acoustic and Electronic guitars which I like playing whenever i feel low.\n- I own a Royal Enfield Classic 350 cc bike, which takes me wherver i want to go (Mountains, plains , off roads..anywhere).\n- I am a big fan of Richard Feynman, his techniques of teaching and his sayings perfectly align my though process.\n\n# I dream of\n\n- always finding inspiration.\n- enabling a brighter future.\n- doing better every day.\n",d=c.split(/\s+/).map((function(e){return e.replace(/\W/g,"")})).filter((function(e){return e.length})).length,h=function(e){var a=Object.assign({},e);return Object(t.jsx)(o.b,Object(i.a)({},a))};a.default=function(){return Object(t.jsx)(l.a,{title:"About",description:"Learn about Anukool Chaturvedi",children:Object(t.jsxs)("article",{className:"post markdown",id:"about",children:[Object(t.jsx)("header",{children:Object(t.jsxs)("div",{className:"title",children:[Object(t.jsx)("h2",{"data-testid":"heading",children:Object(t.jsx)(o.b,{to:"/about",children:"About Me"})}),Object(t.jsxs)("p",{children:["(in about ",d," words)"]})]})}),Object(t.jsx)(r.a,{source:c,renderers:{Link:h},escapeHtml:!1})]})})}}}]);
