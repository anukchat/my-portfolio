# Intro

I am a Data Engineer at [Avalara](https://avalara.com) where I build tools to improve data quality on highly dynamic unstructured as well as complex structured datasets and monitor the quality metrics on it. I am also responsible for creating gold standard datasets and create analytics out of it. I use various Statistics and Machine Learning based techniques to solve complex data quality problems. Prior to Avalara I worked at Tieto, FIS Global & TCS on creating utilities and frameworks for solving complex data quality problems. I personally like doing projects that create social impact like helping Agriculture use modern AI based techniques to increase their productivity, I also have interests in Image Processing, Web3, Robotics & Space technologies. I participate in various hackathons and competetions at Kaggle.

If you think I can be helpful to you or would like to meet me, please feel free to get in touch.

# Currently

At Avalara, I have learned how to build tools for on-line predictive models with technologies like [Dask](https://dask.org/), [Dagster](https://dagster.io/), [PyTorch](https://www.pytorch.org/), and [spaCy](https://spacy.io/). I mostly progrtam in Python , but have good experience in C#, Java, front end technology like React.js, Cloud based services like AWS EC2, Athena, Glue, EMR, DataLake, S3 etc. 

# Some history

- I was born in Steel City of India: Bhilai, famous for Asia's largest Steel Plant and is also famous for its well planned township and high quality education. I was introduced with a computer when I was 6-7 year old, it was a big Black & White box with only a mechanical keyboard and the first program i ran was LOTUS to draw shapes using commands. 

- Thanks to my father , I developed a huge interest in physics and specifically astro physics, my father was a Physics Lecturer and his way of teaching developed a huge interest in me.

- I was first introduced with a proper Windows XP based Pentium IV computer when I was 13 year old, it was a dream to have internet back then. 

- The first computer language i was introduced with was C and C++, I also subscribed digit magazines to explore more on computers.

- The first modern game i played (i still do) in computer was GTA San Andreas , It was the heaviset game which later started effecting my computer.

- I was introduced with internet at an age of 14, it was a dial up connection, back then 2 mbps used to be highest speed one can get.

- I always have been fond of electronic machines and robotics, I enjoyed almost any machine big or small and reverse engineer it to understand its working. At times i used to fix up things but many times I used to just open and leave it as it is. 

- At 16, I bought an advanced tool set out of my pocket money, to start creating projects on Robotics and program micro controllers.

- At 18, I went for graduation in Electronics & Telecommunication , i choose the stream because of huge interest in electronics

- At 21, i presented paper at IEEE conference on an Image Processing based real time Steel Plate monitoring in Steel Plants.
